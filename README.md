## Description
This is a simple, one-page portfolio site, created as the first project for CSCI E-15 Dynamic Web Applications (Fall 2015). It contains answers to a few questions about me and placeholders for links to the course's remaining projects.

## Outside code

I'm using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

## TODO

- improve responsiveness
	- text sizing
- review & clean up CSS
- add footer w/contact info
